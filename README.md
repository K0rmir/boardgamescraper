# Board Game Sale Scraper

This simple script utilises the [Playwright Library](https://playwright.dev/) to scrape a preselected array of board game URLs from Amazon, checks whether or not those games are on sale then, using [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/), sends a email detailing the games on sale.
